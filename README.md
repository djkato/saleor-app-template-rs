# Using this repo

To use, you need to have [Rust environment prepared](https://rustup.rs/).
Every folder represents a different workspace. To add a new lib, do `cargo new <project-name> --lib` or `cargo new <project-name>` for binary apps. It should appear as a new member under root `Cargo.toml`

# Unofficial Saleor App SDK

SDK for building [Saleor Apps](https://github.com/saleor/apps)
to use in your project outside this repo: `cargo add saleor-app-sdk`
to use in your project inside this repo, create a new workspace member and add `saleor-app-sdk.workspace = true` to the members `Cargo.toml`

# Unofficial Saleor App Template

## Creating a new Saleor App from template

If using the `saleor-app-template`, create a new workspace member `cargo new <project-name>`,`rm -rf <project-name>/*` then `cp -r app-template/* <project-name>/`.

## Adding new dependencies

Workspace dependencies need to be managed manually. If you wanna add a new dependency to a single member do `cargo add <dep> --package <project-name>`.
If you want to use a shared dependency, add it to the root level `Cargo.toml`,
then inside your member `Cargo.toml`add it under depencency like: `<dependency> = { workspace = true, features = [ "..." ] }`.

## Developing

To have the app rebuild during development, install bacon `cargo install bacon`, then run `bacon run -- <app-name>` to have bacon watch your code and rerun it on save!

## License

Each workspace member has it's licensed in it's own directory.

### TL;DR:

- saleor-app-sdk, saleor-app-template and the root structure fall under either MIT or Apache 2.0 at your convenience.
- Rest of the apps in this repo fall under `PolyForm-Noncommercial-1.0.md`. If you want to use my apps commercially, each app costs 10â‚¬ (or voluntarily more). Upon payment/donation you are allowed to use the given app commercially.

## Docker images

To build the docker image, log into ghcr.io via docker like `docker login ghcr.io -u <USER> -p <GITHUB KEY WITH PACKAGE PERMS>` run `cargo make`. To publish, run `cargo push-containers`. If you want to push image to your own place, modify `Makefile.toml` and `Dockerfile` to include your username instead of mine.
